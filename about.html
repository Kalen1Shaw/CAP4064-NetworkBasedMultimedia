                    <p>
                        The following are common exercises that we encourage our clients to do as part of their daily exercise routine:
                    </p>
                    <dl>
                        <dt>Burpee</dt>
                        <dd>
                            Burpees are a great, full body exercise to increase your strength and endurance. Being in a standing position, drop into a squat
                            and extend your hands forward. Kick you feet back and then forwards again quickly, and then jump up from a squatted position.
                        </dd>
                        <dt>Plank</dt>
                        <dd>
                            Planks build your core strength. To perform a plank, get in a push-up position and rest your forearms on the floor.
                            Hold the position as long as you can.
                        </dd>
                        <dt>Mountain Climbers</dt>
                        <dd>
                            Mountain Climbers are a good cardio exercise. Place your hands on the floor in a push-up position, then bring one knee
                            up to your chest and then switch as quickly as you can.
                        </dd>
